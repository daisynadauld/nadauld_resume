## Relevant Experience
`January 2023 - Current`
__Idaho National Laboratory__, Modeling and Simulation Intern, Idaho Falls, ID

Projects:
- IGCAPT
  - The Grid Data Total Availability Framework (GDTAF) is a DOE data framework for defining smart-grid power and communication assets. Idaho National Laboratory's simulation product, IGCAPT, assesses communication bandwidth utilization on smart-grid communications networks using Java. My team was assigned to make IGCAPT GDTAF compliant by refactoring the data model and code to support analysis through the web-based interface. Specifically, I worked on decoupling the dependencies between Java Universal Network/Graph Framework (Jung) and Open Street Map JMapviewer, and extracting IGCAPT GUI action events into separate controller classes to subscribe to a Model View Controller pattern.
- DICE
  - DICE is an Air Force training simulation that uses an entity component system design pattern written in C++. I aided in the development of a PK system, the aim of which is to track shooter-target engagement events and calculate a real-time probability-of-kill value. This project exposed me to the Entity Component System design pattern, C++ 11/14 standards, and cross-platform development. It also gave me experience using shared pointers, dynamic pointer casts, and standard template library containers.
- NAERM
  - NAERM is a large project that INL collaborates on with other labs, its aim is to aid in the planning and routing of fiber optics. I was able to work on a few parts of this project. One part was on a Pyhton based tool that validates that the data from incoming .gpkg files is correctly formatted for use by the other tools in its group. I added the ability for this tool to also validate .csv and .shp files. I also worked on creating a CI/CD pipeline in GitLab for the rest of the Python tools in that same group. I created a .yml file that utilizes an Ubuntu container and python 3.10 to run Pylint on each tool and also runs automatic tests of the tools with pre-defined test data.

Skills Gained 
- Collaboration on large projects.
- More in-depth experience with Java.
- Refactoring experience.
- Understanding of Model View Controller patterns.
- More in-depth experience with C++.
- Understanding of Entity Component Systems.
- Understanding of Docker Containers and Virtual Environments.
- Experience with GitLab and CI/CD.
